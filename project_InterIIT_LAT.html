                <h3 class="R-Beanie">{Vortex-sealed Under-Wing Concept}</h3>
                <p class="p1">
                    The front wing was designed as a <strong>vortex-controlled suction system</strong>, where a stable endplate-generated vortex seals the low-pressure region against the surroundings.
                </p>
                <p class="p2">
                    Early concepts showed that strong outboard loading and aggressive endplate curvature produced a powerful vortex, but also injected large amounts of dirty-air. 
                    This contaminated the flow field downstream and destabilized the sealing mechanism.
                    </p>

                    <div class="img-card">

                                -These sketches show why tubular outboard section was needed and capture how 
                                it was expected to entrain and regulate the ground-sealing vortex, and why uncontrolled growth would lead to vortex breakdown and loss of downforce.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="p2">
                        To understand this further, the wing was decomposed into its vortex-producing elements:
                        <br><br> The outer endplate, the lower edge near the ground, and the interaction between the two. 
                        <br><br>CFD & Sketch-based reasoning showed that 
                        uncontrolled strengthening of this vortex leads to vortex breakdown &rarr; the sudden expansion and loss of coherence that causes the seal to collapse.<br><br>
                        
                        The sketches capture two critical observations:
                        <br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When the vortex grows too strong, it "blows up" - it expands, detaches from the ground and loses its ability to seal the low pressure under the wing.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>If external flow is allowed to leak into the vortex core, it accelerates the breakdown.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        This is why a simple Gurney-based or flap-based approach was rejected for the front wing.<br>
                        A Gurney would have increased circulation, but without vortex containment, it would have driven the sealing vortex into an unstable regime.

                        After several iterations, the solution emerged: a two-step endplate system.

        <p class="p1">
            The rear wing was developed around a single idea: <strong>Gurney based vortex-control.</strong>
            Use gurneys to control the vortex's position & strength. These vortices otherwise dilute the pressure difference across the wing.
        </p>

        <p class="p2">
            A deliberately simple baseline was used: a single-element wing extruded between two rectangular endplates.
            This isolates the dominant three-dimensional effect of rear wings:<br> <strong>the lower & upper-edge endplate vortices.</strong>
        </p>

                        <strong>Early Rear-wing Concepts(Design Notebook)</strong><br><br>
                        These sketches show why Gurney-based endplate modifications were needed and help motivate key design decisions.<br>
                        It also demonstrates the further need for improvement since the major culprit- lower edge vortex- is still left unchecked.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="p2">
                In this baseline case, the large pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces drives a vortex at the bottom edge of the endplate.
                <br><br>
                This vortex acts as a <strong>pressure short-circuit</strong>, pulling high-energy suction-side flow into its core and reducing the effective pressure difference that produces downforce.
                <br><br>
                The goal was therefore not to eliminate vortices, but to <strong>control how and where they form.</strong>
                <br><br>
                The first modification was a <strong>flat gurney</strong> added to the trailing edge of the endplate.
                <br><br>
                A gurney increases the effective camber of a lifting surface by creating a stagnation region on one side and a separated region on the other.
                <br><br>
                Applied to the endplate, it reinforces the low-pressure under-wing(this is because circulation across the endplate is increased) & weakens the upper vortex. However, the lower vortex is strengthened (Katz, RaceCar Aerodynamics).

                CFD showed that while near-endplate downforce increased slightly, the <strong>stronger vortex pulled even more low-pressure flow off the wing</strong>, increasing leakage.
                <br><br>
                This revealed a critical insight:
                <br><br>
                <strong>A stronger vortex is not automatically beneficial - if it remains attached to the wing, it degrades suction.</strong>

                The flat gurney increased suction on the upper surface of the wing by enabling strong low-pressure regions to form over the endplate.
                <br><br>
                To counter this, the top of the endplate was cut away in a triangular profile.
                <br><br>
                This reduced pressure drop above the wing while preserving the ability of the endplate to shape the lower vortex.

                The final evolution was to <strong>curve the gurney</strong>.
                <br><br>
                This does not weaken the vortex - it changes its <strong>trajectory</strong>.
                CFD showed that the curved gurney caused the vortex to:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Form earlier</li>

                    <li>And detach into the wake instead of remaining coupled to the suction surface</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Pressure contours confirmed that the low-pressure core was now spatially separated from the wing, preventing it from entraining suction-side flow.
                <br><br>
                In effect, the curved gurney acted as a <strong>vortex management device</strong>, not a lift device.

            <p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                All aerodynamic development shown here was performed on isolated front and rear wings.
                This was a deliberate choice:
                <br><br> 
                Isolating each wing makes the dominant vortex structures and pressure-leakage mechanisms visible and controllable, which is not possible once the wake of one component contaminates the other.
                <br><br>
                In a full car, the front wing’s wake will inevitably interact with the rear wing, and this interaction can shift vortex position, strength, and stability.
                <br><br>
                Those effects were not captured here due to computational limits, but the geometries were designed so their vortex functions remain compatible:
                the front wing produces a structured, ground-attached sealing vortex, while the rear wing is shaped to shed and eject vortices into the wake rather than feed them back into the suction surfaces.
                <br><br>
                This makes the concepts interaction-ready - they are not tuned to a fragile CFD setup, but to survive when placed on a real car.
